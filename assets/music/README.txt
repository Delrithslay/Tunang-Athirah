This folder is for music files used by the invitation page.

Place an MP3 named "music.mp3" here to have the page attempt to play it automatically when you press "Play Music".

If no file is present, the page will synthesize a short gentle melody using the Web Audio API as a fallback.

Replace with your ceremony audio (ensure file name matches: music.mp3)
